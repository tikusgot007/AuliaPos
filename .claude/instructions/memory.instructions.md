> **Compaction note (2026-09-23):** checkpoints for 2026-09-20 through 2026-09-23 (16 sessions, covering the M1 Wave 1 pipeline and the whole M3 Operational Inbox Fase 1 / Fase 2 / Fase 2a + review + refactor-plan pipeline) were compacted on 2026-09-23. Durable findings were promoted below. The 3 most recent checkpoints (2026-09-23 code review, refactor-plan clarification, refactor-plan amendment) were retained.

### Architecture & Patterns

- **Language policy per artifact:** PRD and `docs/audit/` reports are written in **Indonesian**; `/plan/` documents and `REMEDIATION STATUS` blocks are written in **English** (AGENTS.md "English-only documentation"). Conversational replies remain Indonesian. [Still valid 2026-09-23]
- **Strict session isolation:** a locked persona may not switch phase mid-session; the user can override explicitly, but the agent must print `[Session Override Active - Warning: Context Mixing Active]` first. A phase change normally belongs in a NEW session. [Recurring across all sessions]
- **Readiness scoring gate:** audits score 0–100 (Completeness 40 / Clarity 30 / Alignment 30); an unresolved fundamental contradiction caps the score at **79** (Critical Flaw Veto); the PROCEED/REFINE prompt fires at **≥80**; deadlock breaker after 3 iterations.
- **Remediation Protocol:** after an authoring agent revises a document, it appends `REMEDIATION STATUS: RESOLVED` with the projected score. The block goes **immediately after the H1** (front matter → H1 → banner), never above the H1 (see DE-06).
- **Narrow M2 gate (K-01):** the M2 State Consistency gate was opened only as an **expected-owner conditional write** (`WHERE id = ? AND assigned_to = ?` → `affectedRows() === 0` = 409, ownership never overwritten), reusing the existing `ambilPercakapan()` primitive. M2 as a program stays **deferred**; a Spec must say this explicitly and must not expand into a general state-consistency redesign (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §12).
- **Ownership atomicity map (F-02):** `Inbox::ambilPercakapan()` (`app/Controllers/Inbox.php:1069-1097`) is already atomic (conditional UPDATE + `affectedRows()` → 409). The still-non-atomic paths are `lepas` (:1137), `tutup` (:1254), `snooze` (:1203), `tandaiDibaca` (:1170), `hapus` (:1002). Any future "M2 is required" claim must name which path.
- **ADR-0001:** the Queue View computed status (`ConversationModel::withComputedStatus()`) must be a thin layer over the existing `attachResponseState()` in `app/Controllers/Inbox.php`, never a parallel implementation. [Lives only on branch `v2.2` — see DE-30]
- **`conversation_handoffs` table contract (K-05/K-06):** additive migration, DB group `inbox`, English snake_case (`summary`, `next_action`, `note`), indexes `(conversation_id, created_at)` + `to_user_id`, no cross-DB FK to `users`; `conversation_id` = **BIGINT UNSIGNED** (FK to `conversations.id`); `from_user_id` nullable (owner before the write), `initiated_by_user_id` NOT NULL (always from session); the `messages` thread is untouched so REQ-009 stays safe.
- **Handoff HTTP contract (K-07/K-09):** `403` not permitted, `409` lost the race / rejected state (idempotency for free), `400` validation; `summary`/`next_action`/`note` max **4096**; allowed on every tab except `selesai` (collapses to `queue_status !== 'selesai'`); success body mirrors `tutupPercakapan()`.
- **Handoff initiator gate (D-01/P-05):** only a request whose initiator IS the current assignee can reach the conditional write; a non-assignee gets 403. On `belum_diambil` the initiator must be a member of `daftarKasirAktif`, so a non-assignee **admin** also gets 403 (Plan wins over Q2; locked by test E04). Widening the gate is a requirement change requiring `/sdlc-clarify-reqs`.
- **Handoff collision policy (K-04):** collision detection = **write-time conflict only** (409 + name of the lawful owner); Presence is deferred with a named precondition. Reusing an existing primitive on one more path is reversible → no ADR (Triple Gate fails).
- **Internal Note invariant (REQ-009):** `catatanInternal()` must NEVER call `ConversationModel::update()` for `last_message_at`/`last_message_direction`. Internal Note is allowed on `closed` conversations (no status gate).
- **Inbox query facts (verified in code):** `apiConversations()` has no filter params and hardcodes `findAll(100)`; `conversations.last_message_at`/`last_message_direction` are **denormalized** columns written explicitly at 3 message-insert call sites (`Inbox.php:834-835,1455-1456`, `InboxGatewayApi.php:262-263`), not an aggregate query. Filtering is filter-after-fetch in PHP; the limit was raised to `findAll(500)`.
- **Boolean column precedent:** the Inbox schema has **zero** `BOOLEAN` columns; the real precedent is `tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT ...` in the POS module (`CreateAuliaPosCore.php`). Decision `is_internal NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` stands on that justification.
- **SLA color rule:** `menunggu_customer` IS included; only `selesai` and `follow_up` (snoozed) are excluded.
- **CI4 test conventions:** `TestResponse::getJSON()` returns a JSON **string** (`json_decode($response->getJSON(), true)`); migrations are excluded from the composer classmap (`exclude-from-classmap **/Database/Migrations/**`) so a test must `require_once APPPATH . 'Database/Migrations/<file>.php'` first; `Config\Database::$inbox['numberNative'] = false` so DB ids arrive as **strings** (cast `(int)`).
- **MariaDB FK rule:** the child FK column type must match the parent exactly (`BIGINT UNSIGNED` for `conversations.id`) or MariaDB 10.4 rejects the DDL with errno 150.
- **Green/red test signal:** `vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage` is the exit-0 signal. `composer test` exits 1 solely because `phpunit.dist.xml` sets `failOnWarning="true"` plus coverage reports with no driver installed — a pre-existing, unrelated failure.
- **WA-Gateway scope invariant:** code changes only in `C:\projects\WA-Gateway-m1` (branch `feature/stage-1-reliability`), never the live gateway at `C:\projects\WA-Gateway`; never touch the live `auth/` folder. Repo is `tikusgot007/WA-Gateway` (not `tikusgot/...`).
- **Static guard beats runtime simulation:** for "register-before-send" ordering, add a source-reading static guard test (`fs.readFileSync` + regex verifying `register(` precedes `sendMessage(`/`await`); a runtime simulation can pass by accident with loose timing.
- **Repo topology / pointer staleness:** `docs/adr/`, `docs/audit/`, `docs/decisions/` exist **only on branch `v2.2`** — read them read-only via `git show v2.2:<path>`. The `.agents/` tree **does not exist**; the real tree is `.claude/` (`skills/`, `standards/`, `instructions/`). `AGENTS.md` still points documentation standards at the stale `.agents/standards/` (real path `.claude/standards/`).
- **M3 Fase 2 gating history:** Fase 2 was gated on M2 by `blueprint-m3-operational-inbox.md` (lines 100, 117-120, 133), `spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase1.md` §1.1, and PRD line 41 (Non-Goal) — the Non-Goal made Fase 2 an Orphaned Item. Resolved by amending the PRD to **v1.1** (GH-006 Handoff, GH-007 Collision Detection, GH-008 Auto-assignment). Scope split: **Fase 2a = Handoff + Collision Detection**, **Fase 2b = Auto-assignment**.
- **PRD bypass synergy (heavy lifting):** when the PRD is bypassed, the Spec guesses missing technical details and flags them with `[WARNING] [ASSUMPTION-00N]`; downstream agents must NOT block, only extract to "Risks & Assumptions"; the Clarification agent targets those assumptions first.
- **Dokumen hilang permanen:** `Panduan_Layar_AuliaPos_M3.md` and `status-proyek-master.md` were **never committed in any branch or tag** although the blueprint/spec cite them as basis. Fase 2 behavior must come from recorded decisions, never from those files.
- **Branch topology (as of 2026-09-22/23):** the project moved from the archived `claude/m1-wave1-plan-clarify-y1km3u` to **`v2.3`**; Fase 2a work happens on `feature/m3-operational-inbox-fase1a-task001`.

### Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat)

| # | Attempted | Why It Failed | Correct Solution |
|---|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| DE-01 | Running dependent git commands (`add`+`commit` pairs) as parallel tool calls in one response | They race on `.git/index.lock` ("File exists"); the interleaving produced a commit whose content did not match its message | Chain git commands with `;` inside ONE command string (sequential), never parallel calls; repair with `git reset --soft HEAD~1` + `git reset` |
| DE-02 | `git diff $base..HEAD` in PowerShell | PowerShell parses `$base..HEAD` as the **range operator**, so git received malformed args and printed usage | Build the range as a string first (`$range = $base + '..HEAD'`) or quote it |
| DE-03 | `$response->assertSee('id="panel"', false)` | CI4's signature is `assertSee(?string $search, ?string $element)` — the 2nd arg is a **CSS selector**; `false` coerced to `''` and DOMParser threw "read property length on bool" | Use `(string) $response->getBody()` + `assertStringContainsString`, or `assertSee($search)` with one argument |
| DE-04 | Piping phpunit through PowerShell (`vendor\bin\phpunit ... \| Select-Object -Last 6`) and reading the 30 s timeout as "too slow, run detached" | The console/pipe path is the slow part; phpunit itself runs the suite in ~5 s | `cmd /c 'vendor\bin\phpunit --no-coverage > build\<name>.txt 2>&1'` then read the file |
| DE-05 | `npx --no-install markdownlint-cli <file> > build\out.txt 2>&1` in PowerShell | PowerShell turns the CLI's stderr into a `NativeCommandError` and aborts the pipeline → the redirect file ends up empty | `cmd /c "npx --no-install markdownlint-cli <file> > build\out.txt 2>&1"` then read the file |
| DE-06 | Placing the remediation banner **above** the H1 of an audit report (copying the older m2-gate report) | Introduced a NEW `MD041/first-line-heading` finding on an otherwise clean file | Put the banner immediately **after** the H1 (front matter → H1 → banner) |
| DE-07 | `git commit -F -` from PowerShell 5.1 | PS 5.1 does not feed stdin that way; git treats the message as a pathspec | Commit from Git Bash with a heredoc (`git commit -F - <<'EOF'`), or write the message to a file |
| DE-08 | Integrity-checking a suspect SQLite file by opening it with a **writable** connection, then moving `-wal`/`-shm` aside | Closing a writable connection lets SQLite delete `-wal`/`-shm` itself → only 1 of 3 files was quarantined (violates REQ-013) | Probe with a read-only connection first (`{ readonly: true, fileMustExist: true }`) |
| DE-09 | PowerShell commands combining `Remove-Item` with a regex containing `\s*`, or with `cmd /c` | The command-safety check blocks them before anything runs | Split into separate calls; detach a junction with `cmd /c rmdir` (never `Remove-Item -Recurse` over a junction in PS 5.1); do file rewrites with a small Node script |
| DE-10 | Text-mutation helpers that assume LF line endings on the Windows checkouts | The checkouts are **CRLF**, so `\n` mutations silently did not apply | Convert `\n` → `\r\n` inside mutation helpers |
| DE-11 | Reading phpunit output containing ✔ through the console | Console CP1252 mangles the ✔ glyph | `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText($p, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)` |
| DE-12 | `json_decode($response->getBody(), true)` in a CI4 feature test | Returns `null` (the body is already consumed/stream) | `json_decode($response->getJSON(), true)` |
| DE-13 | Instantiating a migration class directly in a test (`new CreateConversationHandoffs()`) | Migrations are excluded from the composer classmap | `require_once APPPATH . 'Database/Migrations/<file>.php';` first |
| DE-14 | Declaring the migration FK child column `INT UNSIGNED` to match the Plan/Spec wording while pointing at `conversations.id` | MariaDB 10.4 rejects mismatched FK types (errno 150) | Child must be `BIGINT UNSIGNED` (same as `messages.conversation_id`); document the deviation in the migration docblock |
| DE-15 | Asserting a composite index by expecting one `SHOW INDEX` row | `SHOW INDEX` returns one row **per indexed column** (a 2-column index = 2 rows) | Assert on the row set, not a single row; note MariaDB 10.x normalizes `id DESC` in index DDL (backward scan still avoids filesort) |
| DE-16 | Comparing DB integer ids with `assertSame(int)` straight from a query result | `Config\Database::$inbox['numberNative'] = false` → ids arrive as **strings** | Cast with `(int)` in assertions (existing test convention) |
| DE-17 | Using bare `composer test` as the green/red signal | It exits 1 solely because `phpunit.dist.xml` sets `failOnWarning="true"` + coverage with no driver → "No code coverage driver available" (pre-existing) | Use `vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage` for an exit-0 signal |
| DE-18 | Appending test methods with `editor insert_line` at an estimated line number, and sending `new_text` blocks >6000 chars | The tool rejects oversized payloads; an approximated `insert_line` splits an in-progress method → "unexpected token public" / "Cannot redeclare" fatals needing a full-file rewrite | Count lines first (`(Get-Content $f).Count`) or anchor on a unique short `old_text`; keep chunks well under 6000 chars |
| DE-19 | Passing one large multi-line `old_text` block to the editor | It did not match exactly once → "text not found" twice although the text looked identical | Anchor on ONE line or a short unique substring, or use `insert_line`, then a second targeted edit |
| DE-20 | Measuring file content with bare `Get-Content` in PowerShell 5.1 | It decodes UTF-8 as CP1252 and shows mojibake dashes | `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText($path, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8)` |
| DE-21 | Anchoring an editor replacement on a line containing `Config\\Inbox` | The file literally contains a **double** backslash, so a single-backslash `old_text` never matched | Anchor on a backslash-free line (e.g. the following `## 9.` heading), or use `insert_line` |
| DE-22 | Sending `expected_owner = <id>` for a conversation that is actually unassigned in a test payload | The server correctly answered **409** (the claim was stale), so the test failed for the wrong reason | The lawful "not yet taken" claim is an empty value (`expected_owner = ''`, Q5) — the conditional write matches `NULL <=> NULL` |
| DE-23 | `php -r 'var_dump((string) ["x"]);'` through PowerShell 5.1 | PS strips the inner double quotes when handing args to a native command → PHP parse error | Use a double-quoted PS string with **no** inner double quotes (`array(1)`, `chr(195)`), or write a temp file |
| DE-24 | `npx --no-install markdownlint-cli2 --version` (or plain `markdownlint`) to lint new docs | This repo has no `package.json` / local install → npx refuses ("canceled due to missing packages") | Use `npx --no-install markdownlint-cli` — the CLI **IS** available (v0.49.1; default MD013 limit is 80 chars). This supersedes the earlier "no markdownlint CLI available" note |
| DE-25 | `Select-String -Pattern 'a\|b'` with `\'`-escaped alternatives inside one quoted string | PowerShell parameter-binding error (`A positional parameter cannot be found`) | Use a double-quoted pattern or one pattern per call |
| DE-26 | Killing the Gateway to hit the "message sent but response lost" window | The window is about **1 ms** | Suspend the process (NtSuspendProcess) for longer than the 10 s AuliaPos timeout instead |
| DE-27 | Routing straight to `/sdlc-define-specs` for M3 Fase 2 because the Fase 2 checkpoint was recorded in memory | Fase 2 is gated on M2 by 3 upstream docs and would be an Orphaned Item (PRD declared it a Non-Goal) → `audit-consistency` would fail | One `/sdlc-clarify-reqs` session decides the narrow atomicity scope, then `/sdlc-define-specs` |
| DE-28 | Accepting the blueprint/spec claim "ownership is application-level, not atomic" and designing a general state-consistency fix | The claim is **stale for the take path** — `ambilPercakapan()` already performs a conditional UPDATE + `affectedRows()`; a general redesign also violates ARCHITECTURE §12 | Name WHICH path is non-atomic (the F-02 list) instead of redesigning the module |
| DE-29 | Diffing local `v2.2` against a feature branch to gauge PR scope (got 207 files / +81k) | The local `v2.2` branch ref was **stale**; `origin/v2.2` was actually identical to the merge-base | Always `git fetch origin <branch>` and diff against `origin/<branch>`, never a possibly-stale local ref |
| DE-30 | Reading `docs/adr/0001-...md` on the active branch | `docs/adr/` does not exist there; it lives only on `v2.2` | Read read-only with `git show v2.2:<path>` |
| DE-31 | Editing `docs/TODO-CHAT.md` while it was open in Word | Word locks the file (`~$` lock file, EPERM) | Ask the user to close Word first |
| DE-32 | Re-asking already-locked clarification items (Q1–Q8 / F-C05) in a follow-up session | All are recorded `[Disepakati — kunci]`; re-prompting violates the session rule | Mark accepted items `[Assumed / Out of Scope]` and never re-ask; point the new session back to the checkpoint |
| DE-33 | Claiming the decrypt errors came from session contamination from `/send`, and that the buffer preserves the original message time | The first was retracted then partly reinstated by correlation (unproven); the second is wrong because the timestamp Gateway receives is already shifted | Label proven vs hypothesis; a discriminating test needs a second, never-contacted test number |
| DE-34 | Reading `build/md-clarify-refactor.txt` being **0 bytes** as "clean lint" | 0 bytes was an empty redirect, not a clean lint run | The real baseline for these audit reports is MD013-only; never read "0 bytes" as "0 findings" |
| DE-35 | Replacing a whole PRD/Spec section by passing one large multi-line `old_text` block | The block did not match exactly once; the edit failed with "text not found" although the text looked identical | Anchor on one line / short unique substring, or use `insert_line`, then a follow-up targeted edit |

### Key Metrics & Baselines

- **AuliaPos PHPUnit suite:** **283 tests / 867 assertions** OK (2026-09-23, after M3 Fase 2a). Pre-Fase-2a baseline was 239 tests / 553 assertions (Fase 2a added 44 tests).
- **Inbox-module regression filter:** 77 tests / 424 assertions OK (2026-09-23).
- **M3 Fase 2a handoff test file:** `tests/session/InboxHandoffTest.php` — 26 tests / 192 assertions (H01–H08, C01–C04, G01–G05, E01–E08).
- **M3 Fase 2a boundary delta:** `app/Controllers/Inbox.php` **+312 / −0** (the 7 protected methods byte-identical); `app/Views/inbox/index.php` +325 / −1; zero diff on `ConversationModel.php`, `InboxSlaService.php`, `InboxGatewayApi.php`.
- **markdownlint baseline:** audit reports are **MD013-only**; plan/architecture docs effectively tolerate MD013 up to 400 chars (default limit 80). `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` carries ~32 × MD013.
- **WA-Gateway M1:** 17 `test/simulate-*.js` scripts + 1 static guard `test/check-register-before-send.js`, all passing; branch `feature/stage-1-reliability`, 13 commits above `091fe19`.

## 📝 Session Checkpoint: 2026-09-23 (M3 Fase 2a Code Review)

- **Active Memory Path:** `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md`
- **Current SDLC Phase:** Review (`/sdlc-code-review`) — M3 Fase 2a (Handoff + Collision Detection) audited over
  `600515c~1..HEAD` @ `3968aa0` (branch `feature/m3-operational-inbox-fase1a-task001`). Verdict: **0 Blocker, 0 Critical,
  2 Major, 8 Minor**. **No source code was touched** — the session produced a review report plus a refactoring plan, then
  stopped at the handoff gate.
- **Active Artifacts:**
  - `docs/audit/code-review-m3-fase2a-2026-09-23.md` — Status: ✅ new (Axis A/B review, findings CR-01..CR-10,
    traceability matrix REQ/CON → code → test, mutation-sensitivity table, frontend review, final verdict). 271 lines.
  - `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` — Status: ✅ new (mandatory refactoring template; Phase 1 =
    TASK-101..TASK-110 unconditional hardening/tests, Phase 2 = TASK-201..TASK-205 clarification-gated). 171 lines.
  - `plan/plan-feature-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-v1.0.md` — ✅ delivered, unchanged (Completed/Date columns still blank).
  - `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` — 🔄 still v1.0 with the stale wording (RISK-01).
- **Achieved Milestones:**
  - Baseline re-verified independently: `vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage` → **OK (283 tests, 867 assertions)**.
  - Boundary claims re-verified by my own commands: `--numstat '600515c~1..HEAD'` = 7 files only, `Inbox.php`
    **312 insertions / 0 deletions** (7 protected methods byte-identical), zero diff on `ConversationModel.php`,
    `InboxSlaService.php`, `InboxGatewayApi.php`, the view diff is exactly 1 replaced toolbar line, and the migration only
    creates `conversation_handoffs` (no ALTER on `messages`/`conversations`). Test inventory 7+7+4+26 = 44 new tests.
  - Findings: **MAJOR CR-01** — `summary`/`next_action`/`note` are `(string)`-coerced, so an array payload stores the literal
    `"Array"` (proven with `php -r`: warning + `trim('Array') !== ''`); **MAJOR CR-02** — the locked Q5 contract
    "absent `expected_owner` = 400" has **no test**, so a refactor could silently turn it into 409/200 with the suite green.
  - **MINOR CR-03** — initiator gate keys on `assigned_to IS NULL` (superset of `queue_status === 'belum_diambil'`; reachable
    after snooze + `lepas`, no ownership overwritten, needs a product decision); **CR-04** — write uses the client
    `expected_owner` while `from_user_id` comes from the pre-transaction read (hair-thin race → stale audit value);
    **CR-05** — `strlen` (bytes) vs `mb_strlen` (chars) for the 4096 cap; **CR-06** — the `selesai` 409 lacks
    `current_owner_id`; **CR-07** — micro-contract test gaps (malformed `to_user_id`, oversized `note`, JSON dual-read,
    POST `auth` filter, gate order on double violations, 409 body key set, Asia/Jakarta); **CR-08** — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
    never names `UserModel::daftarKasirAktif()` even though TASK-014 asked for it; **CR-09** — missing blank line at
    `Inbox.php:1215` + a 240-line method; **CR-10** — K-05's `to_user_id` index intentionally absent (YAGNI, no action).
  - Mutation-sensitivity assessment (static, no code changed): `C01`/`C02`/`E06` lock the conditional write,
    `C03` locks the rollback (real MariaDB trigger), `H07`/`G01` lock "Handoff never writes messages", `G02` locks
    cap/newest-first, `E07` locks snooze preservation, `H05`/`H08`/`C01b`/`E04` lock the 403 gates.
- **Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat):**
  - **Attempted:** `php -r 'var_dump((string) ["x"]);'` through PowerShell 5.1.
    **Reason:** PS strips the inner double quotes when handing arguments to a native command → PHP parse error.
    **Note:** use a double-quoted PS string with **no** inner double quotes (`array(1)`, `chr(195)`), or write a temp file.
  - **Attempted:** `npx --no-install markdownlint-cli2 --version` (and the plain `markdownlint` variant) to lint new docs.
    **Reason:** this repo has no `package.json` and no local install → npx refuses ("canceled due to missing packages");
    the MD013 counts in earlier checkpoints came from the VS Code extension, not a CLI.
    **Note:** lint manually with a small PowerShell rule script (MD009/MD010/MD012/MD013@400/MD022/MD032/MD058) — do not
    install packages just to lint.
  - **Attempted:** `Select-String -Pattern 'a|b'` with `\'`-escaped alternatives inside one quoted string.
    **Reason:** PowerShell parameter-binding error (`A positional parameter cannot be found`). **Note:** use a
    double-quoted pattern or one pattern per call.
  - **Confirmed still true:** `AGENTS.md` points at `.agents/` for skills, standards and the memory file, but `.agents/`
    **does not exist** in this repo — the real tree is `.claude/` (`skills/`, `standards/`, `instructions/`).
  - Referenced by label only (already documented in earlier checkpoints, still repo-wide): parallel git calls race on
    `.git/index.lock`; `$base..HEAD` is the PowerShell range operator; `TestResponse::assertSee`'s second argument is a CSS
    selector; phpunit piped through PowerShell is the slow part.

- **Updated Files:**
  - `docs/audit/code-review-m3-fase2a-2026-09-23.md` — new review report artifact (committed in `811221d`).
  - `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` — new refactoring plan artifact (committed in `811221d`).
  - `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md` — this checkpoint appended (append-only).
  - `git status --porcelain` shows **only those two untracked files** — no `app/`, `tests/`, or config file was modified.
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Reviewer scope honoured strictly: report + plan only; every fix is assigned to `/sdlc-write-code`.
  - Artifact languages: review report in Indonesian (matches its `docs/audit/` siblings), refactoring plan in English
    (matches `/plan/` siblings and the AGENTS.md "English-only documentation" rule).
  - CR-03 and CR-04 were deliberately **not** patched: they touch locked semantics (P-05/Q5), so they were gated behind
    `/sdlc-clarify-reqs` inside the plan (Phase 2) instead of being changed silently.
  - No new ADR (the findings are reversible hardening with no new trade-off).
  - Lint was validated with a manual PowerShell rule script (no CLI available); both artifacts report 0 issues.
- **Next Action / Pending:**
  - **NEW session:** `/sdlc-write-code` with `@plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` → execute Phase 1
    (TASK-101..TASK-109), run the VERIFY gate, then stop at TASK-110 for explicit approval.
  - **NEW session:** `/sdlc-clarify-reqs` for CR-03 (gate reading), CR-04 (fail-fast 409) and the still-open
    Plan-vs-Q2 admin question; those answers unblock Phase 2 (TASK-201..TASK-205).
  - Both artifacts plus this checkpoint are committed and pushed as `811221d` on
    `feature/m3-operational-inbox-fase1a-task001` (origin in sync, fast-forward `3968aa0..811221d`).
  - This memory file **still has no Knowledge Base zone** — the dead-end list has now survived four checkpoints
    (git-lock, PS range operator, `assertSee` signature, phpunit pipe, plus `php -r` quoting and the missing markdownlint
    CLI); a Compaction Mode run is overdue and should finally create the Knowledge Base zone.

## 📝 Session Checkpoint: 2026-09-23 (M3 Fase 2a Refactor-Plan Clarification)

- **Active Memory Path:** `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md`
- **Current SDLC Phase:** Clarification (`/sdlc-clarify-reqs`) — **completed** for
  `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` (Review Iteration 1). No source code was touched, and the
  plan itself was deliberately NOT edited (persona boundary: its five amendments belong to `/sdlc-plan-tasks`).
- **Active Artifacts:**
  - `docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md` — ✅ new, 211 lines, Readiness **86/100**
    (Completeness 34/40, Clarity 26/30, Alignment 26/30, no Critical Flaw Veto); User Decision Prompt = PROCEED.
  - `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` — 🔄 unchanged by this session; five amendments pending
    (TASK-201 insertion point + regression set, TASK-108 helper signature, TASK-202 third message branch + 3 tests,
    TASK-203 marked VOID, TASK-104 single test id).
  - `CONTEXT.md` — ✅ updated this session: new `### Kepemilikan Percakapan` with the canonical terms **Belum Diambil**
    and **Tanpa Pemilik**, plus the Handoff exception tightened to "percakapan yang tampil di tab Belum Diambil".
  - `plan/plan-feature-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-v1.0.md` and
    `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` — unchanged; Spec finalisation still owes the
    Q2 narrowing sentence and the P-01..P-06 / 4096 / 409 boundary text.
- **Achieved Milestones:**
  - **CR-04 locked = A1:** fail-fast 409 inserted **immediately before `$db->transBegin()`** (`Inbox.php:1120`), i.e.
    AFTER both 403 gates; body byte-identical to the loser 409; helper signature
    `balas409KepemilikanBasi(?int $currentOwnerId)` (the race path keeps its own `find()`); full regression set
    `C01, C01b, C02, C04, E04, E06, H01, H06, H08`.
  - **CR-03 locked = A (TASK-202):** initiator gate keys off `queue_status === 'belum_diambil'` (reusing `$computed`
    from `:992`) + UI mirror `index.php:859-862` + three tests, AND a **third 403 message branch** is required
    (the existing wording of branches (i)/(ii) is locked by `E04(b)` `:750` and `E04(c)` `:762`).
  - **Product question settled:** the Plan wins over Q2 — an admin who is not the assignee stays **403** on
    `belum_diambil` (zero code/test/UI change; the admin loses nothing because `ambilPercakapan()` `:1387-1389`
    allows an unconditional admin claim first). Q2 must be restated as a deliberate narrowing at Spec finalisation.
  - Verified from code (not from the review's claims): unowned-and-not-`belum_diambil` states are reachable via
    mark-read + `lepas` (tab `menunggu`) and snooze + `lepas` (tab `ditunda`); the ABA window (`lepas :1449` then
    `ambil :1387-1391`); all four deterministic `expected` vs `read` combinations are behaviour-preserving under the
    fail-fast; `withComputedStatus()` (`ConversationModel.php:133-170`) sets `belum_diambil` only for
    `perlu_dibalas` + no owner.
  - Three near-blockers in the plan text: **CL-01** wrong insertion point (would flip non-assignee 403 → 409 and leak
    the owner name), **CL-02** incomplete regression list, **CL-03** TASK-108 signature/justification; plus **CL-04**
    glossary ambiguity and **CL-05** test-id divergence.

- **Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat):**
  - **Attempted:** capturing `npx --no-install markdownlint-cli <file>` output with a PowerShell redirect
    (`npx ... > build\out.txt 2>&1`).
    **Reason:** PowerShell converts the CLI's stderr into a `NativeCommandError` and aborts the pipeline, so the
    redirect file ends up empty and only one finding is ever shown.
    **Note:** use `cmd /c "npx --no-install markdownlint-cli <file> > build\out.txt 2>&1"` and then read the file.
    This **supersedes the earlier "no markdownlint CLI available" note** — the CLI IS available
    (`npx --no-install markdownlint-cli`, v0.49.1; the default MD013 limit is 80 characters).
  - Repo-wide dead-ends unchanged, referenced by label only: git index lock on parallel git calls, PowerShell
    `$base..HEAD` range operator, `TestResponse::assertSee` second-argument selector, phpunit piped through PowerShell.
- **Updated Files:**
  - `docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md` — new (this session's deliverable).
  - `CONTEXT.md` — added the `### Kepemilikan Percakapan` section (2 canonical terms) and tightened the Handoff
    definition; no other term touched.
  - `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md` — this checkpoint appended (append-only).
  - No `app/`, `tests/`, `plan/`, `spec/` or config file was modified; `git status` should show only the untracked
    `docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md` plus the modified `CONTEXT.md`.
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Clarification Analyst boundary honoured: report + glossary only; every plan fix assigned to `/sdlc-plan-tasks`,
    every code fix to `/sdlc-write-code`.
  - Markdown lint of the new report: MD025 and MD004 driven to zero (front matter without a duplicate `title:`;
    numbered sub-items instead of wrapped lines starting with `+`, which markdownlint otherwise reads as `+` bullets).
    Residual **121 × MD013** (80-column default) matches the repo-wide pre-existing baseline — the sibling
    clarification report carries 49 × MD013 + 10 × MD049 with a 469-character maximum vs 117 here.
  - No new ADR (Triple Gate fails: reversible text clarifications with no new trade-off).
- **Next Action / Pending:**
  - **NEW session:** `/sdlc-plan-tasks` to apply the five amendments to
    `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md`, then append `REMEDIATION STATUS: RESOLVED` at the top of
    the new clarification report (AGENTS.md Remediation Protocol).
  - **NEW session:** `/sdlc-write-code` Phase 1 (TASK-101..TASK-110) — unaffected by this session, except that
    TASK-108 now has a justified second caller.
  - Spec finalisation still owes the Q2 narrowing sentence and the P-01..P-06 / 4096 / 409 boundary text.
  - This memory file **still has no Knowledge Base zone** (now overdue across five checkpoints); a Compaction Mode run
    should create it and promote the dead-end list.

<!-- checkpoint-tail: M3 Fase 2a refactor-plan clarification is DONE — CR-04 locked to a fail-fast 409 placed after both 403 gates (helper `balas409KepemilikanBasi(?int)`), CR-03 locked to `queue_status === 'belum_diambil'` with a third 403 message branch and three new tests, and the Plan-vs-Q2 admin question settled in favour of the Plan (admin stays 403 on belum_diambil); artifact docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md (86/100), CONTEXT.md gained Belum Diambil vs Tanpa Pemilik, and the plan's five amendments are pending in a new /sdlc-plan-tasks session before /sdlc-write-code Phase 1. -->

## 📝 Session Checkpoint: 2026-09-23 (M3 Fase 2a Refactor-Plan Amendment)

- **Active Memory Path:** `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md`
- **Current SDLC Phase:** Planning (`/sdlc-plan-tasks`) — **completed** for the five clarifications-locked amendments on
  `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md`, plus the mandatory `REMEDIATION STATUS: RESOLVED` block.
  Planner boundary honoured: no source code, test, Spec or PRD file was touched (only the plan + the audit report).
- **Active Artifacts:**
  - `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` — ✅ amended in place (+112 / −29; 254 lines). Phase 1
    (TASK-101..TASK-110) executable now; Phase 2 (TASK-201..TASK-205) no longer clarification-gated.
  - `docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md` — ✅ `REMEDIATION STATUS: RESOLVED` added as
    the first body block after the H1 (lines 10-51); projected Readiness **94/100** (37 + 28 + 29, no Critical Flaw Veto).
  - `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` — ⏳ still stale; owes the Q2 narrowing sentence
    and the P-01..P-06 / 4096 / 409 boundary text. That obligation is now recorded inside the plan's `GOAL-002`.
- **Achieved Milestones:**
  - Five amendments applied surgically: (1) TASK-201 — insertion point "around lines 1088-1104" replaced by
    "immediately before `$db->transBegin()`, AFTER both 403 gates", with the reason recorded (an earlier placement flips
    non-assignees 403 → 409 and leaks the owner name = Q3 violation) and the regression set expanded to
    `C01, C01b, C02, C04, E04, E06, H01, H06, H08` + `TEST-006` (mirrored in TASK-108/TEST-006/RISK-002);
    (2) TASK-108 — helper signature `private function balas409KepemilikanBasi(?int $currentOwnerId)`, two documented
    callers, no ownership re-read inside the helper; (3) TASK-202 — server gate on `$computed['queue_status']`
    (reuse of `:992`, zero extra queries) + UI mirror `index.php:859-862` + THREE 403 message branches ((i)/(ii)
    verbatim, locked by `E04(c)`:762 and `E04(b)`:750) + three tests; (4) TASK-203 marked VOID; (5) TASK-104 single id
    `H02b` and TASK-102 canonical id `E10` (the review's suggested name is an illustrative label only).
  - **Line-number correction verified against the tree:** `$db->transBegin()` is at `app/Controllers/Inbox.php:1126`;
    line 1120 starts its six-line comment block (the clarification report cites `:1120`). Both the plan and the report
    now state this explicitly so the implementor cannot mis-anchor the fail-fast 409.
  - Long-detail overflow moved into two "detail blocks" (TASK-108 after the Phase 1 table; TASK-201/TASK-202 after the
    Phase 2 table) so that no line exceeds 400 characters — max is 394, unchanged from the pre-amendment file.
  - Verification: `markdownlint` (repo-cached CLI) on the plan → MD013 only, zero structural findings; on the amended
    report → MD013 only; `git diff --numstat` on the plan = 112 insertions / 29 deletions.
- **Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat):**
  - **Attempted:** placing the remediation banner *above* the H1 of the audit report, mirroring
    `clarification-report-m3-fase2-m2-gate-2026-09-22.md` (whose banner sits above its H1).
    **Reason:** on this report it introduced a NEW `MD041/first-line-heading` finding on a file that was otherwise
    clean; the older file is simply lint-dirty, so it is not a safe precedent to copy.
    **Note:** put the banner immediately **after** the H1 (front matter → H1 → banner). Also,
    `build/md-clarify-refactor.txt` being 0 bytes was an **empty redirect**, not a clean lint run — the real baseline
    for these audit reports is MD013-only, so "0 bytes" must never be read as "0 findings".
  - Repo-wide dead-ends unchanged, referenced by label only: git index lock on parallel git calls, PowerShell
    `$base..HEAD` range operator, `TestResponse::assertSee` selector, phpunit piped through PowerShell, and the
    `cmd /c "... > file 2>&1"` form required for markdownlint output capture.
- **Updated Files:**
  - `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` — the five amendments plus the consistency updates they
    imply (REQ-007/REQ-008 LOCKED labels, Phase 2 heading/GOAL-002 unblocking + the Q2 note, TEST-006/TEST-007,
    RISK-002/003/004, FILE-001/002/004/005, and the closing Handoff paragraph).
  - `docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md` — remediation block (lines 10-51).
  - `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md` — this checkpoint appended (append-only).
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Amendments applied strictly in place (Surgical Edit Mandate); no new task was added and no requirement text changed
    beyond the five items. The consistency consequences listed above were reported to the user explicitly rather than
    being slipped in silently.
  - TASK-108 extraction range corrected to `:1148-1159` (owner-name resolution + payload), because `find()` at
    `:1144-1147` stays with the caller. "The helper performs no query of its own" means no ownership re-read, NOT
    "no `UserModel` lookup" — the name resolution stays inside the helper to keep the 409 body byte-identical.
  - No new ADR (Triple Gate still fails: reversible text clarifications, no new trade-off).
- **Next Action / Pending:**
  - **NEW session:** `/sdlc-write-code` **Phase 1 (TASK-101..TASK-110)** with the plan, the code-review report and the
    normative feature plan attached; VERIFY via TASK-109 (`vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage`, ≥ 283 tests /
    867 assertions, zero skips), then STOP for explicit approval (TASK-110).
  - **After that approval:** Phase 2 (TASK-201..TASK-205) — no longer gated; ship server + UI in the same commit for
    TASK-202 because the UI mirror must not offer an action that is guaranteed 403.
  - Spec finalisation still owes the Q2 narrowing sentence and the P-01..P-06 / 4096 / 409 text.
  - This memory file **still has no Knowledge Base zone** (overdue across six checkpoints) — a Compaction Mode run
    should create it and promote the accumulated dead-end list.

<!-- checkpoint-tail: M3 Fase 2a refactor-plan AMENDMENT is DONE — all five clarification-locked amendments are in the plan (TASK-201 placed immediately before `$db->transBegin()`, now verified as `Inbox.php:1126` not `:1120`, with the 9-test regression set; TASK-108 signature `balas409KepemilikanBasi(?int $currentOwnerId)`; TASK-202 three 403 branches + three tests with the server gate on `$computed['queue_status']` and the UI mirror at `index.php:859-862`; TASK-203 VOID; TASK-104 single id `H02b`), the clarification report carries `REMEDIATION STATUS: RESOLVED` with a projected 94/100, markdownlint is MD013-only, and the next step is `/sdlc-write-code` Phase 1 (TASK-101..TASK-110) in a new session. -->

## 📝 Session Checkpoint: 2026-09-23 (M3 Fase 2a Write-Code: Phase 1 + Phase 2)

- **Active Memory Path:** `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md`
- **Current SDLC Phase:** Implementation (`/sdlc-write-code`) — **completed** for BOTH phases of
  `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md`: Phase 1 (TASK-101..TASK-110) then, after explicit user
  approval, Phase 2 (TASK-201..TASK-205). One session; one task = one small commit; each task shipped its test in the
  same increment. Branch `feature/m3-operational-inbox-fase1a-task001`, baseline `bf9614e`, HEAD `51fb1fc`.
- **Active Artifacts:**
  - `plan/plan-refactor-m3-fase2a-handoff-collision-v1.0.md` — ✅ executed (both phases apply the 5 locked amendments).
  - `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` — ⏳ still stale (owes the Q2 narrowing sentence
    + P-01..P-06 / 4096 / 409 text); the next NON-code step (a NEW `/sdlc-define-specs` session).
- **Achieved Milestones:**
  - **Phase 1 commits:** `3136792` TASK-101 (`is_string()` guard before coercion, test E09); `dc14a83` TASK-102 (test E10
    for Q5 `expected_owner` absent → 400 + negative control); `77d822e` TASK-103 (`strlen`→`mb_strlen`, tests E11/E12);
    `2b4b3f6` TASK-104 (`current_owner_id` on the `selesai` 409 + test H02b); `d456da6` TASK-105 (six micro-contract tests
    E13–E18); `bb2e0b5` TASK-106 (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` names `UserModel::daftarKasirAktif()`); `f2aab5e` TASK-107
    (blank line); `ba31d9e` TASK-108 (helper `balas409KepemilikanBasi(?int $currentOwnerId)`).
  - **Phase 2 commit:** `51fb1fc` TASK-201 + TASK-202 — server + UI in one commit per RISK-004. TASK-201: fail-fast 409
    `if ($expectedOwner !== $assignedTo) return $this->balas409KepemilikanBasi($assignedTo);` placed AFTER both 403 gates
    and immediately BEFORE `$db->transBegin()`; no write on that path. TASK-202: unowned initiator exception narrowed to
    `($computed['queue_status'] ?? null) === 'belum_diambil' && in_array($userId, $idKasirAktif, true)`; three-branch 403
    message ((i)/(ii) verbatim, (iii) new); UI mirror `index.php` `dapatHandoff` gate. Tests F01 (no-write fail-fast),
    F02 (tab `ditunda` → 403), F03 (tab `menunggu` → 403), F04 (positive control after `ambilPercakapan()` → 200).
    TASK-203 remained VOID (not executed).
  - **VERIFY (TASK-109 + TASK-204):** full suite `vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage` → Phase 1 **294 tests / 930 assertions**;
    Phase 2 **298 tests / 948 assertions** (baseline 283/867 → +15 tests / +81 assertions), zero skips/suppressions, zero
    `ALTER TABLE` on `messages`/`conversations`. All 7 protected methods show **0 occurrences in the full diff**; zero diff
    on `ConversationModel.php` / `InboxSlaService.php` / `InboxGatewayApi.php`.
  - **RISK-005 not triggered:** E15 (JSON body → 200) passed as-is, no seam added.
- **Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat):**
  - **Attempted:** chaining `git add ... && git commit ...` (or any `&&`) through the default shell.
    **Reason:** the default shell here is PowerShell, which rejects `&&` ("token '&&' is not a valid statement separator")
    and mangles inner double quotes.
    **Note:** chain with `;` in PowerShell, or use `cmd /c "git add ... & git commit -F build\<msg>.txt"`; commit messages
    go through a temp file (`-F`) because inline `-m "..."` quoting gets split into pathspecs.
  - **Attempted (environmental, not code):** running the suite before migrations were applied.
    **Reason:** the `inbox` group DB had no `conversation_handoffs` table → 40 spurious errors (setup, never a regression).
    **Note:** apply the EXISTING repo migration with `php spark migrate` (no new migration, no schema change).
  - **Editor auto-format side effect:** VS Code format-on-save reformatted lines OUTSIDE the edited ranges (e.g.
    `fn (` → `fn(`, `if` reflow in `Inbox.php`; broad reflow in `index.php` plus pre-existing Intelephense "Undefined
    variable" false positives on the view). Pure cosmetics on top of the intended change — report, never hide; do a
    selective `revert`/`rebase` if a byte-exact diff is ever required.
  - Repo-wide dead-ends unchanged, referenced by label only: phpunit piped through PowerShell (use
    `cmd /c 'vendor\bin\phpunit --no-coverage > build\<name>.txt 2>&1'` then read the file — DE-04), git index lock on
    parallel git calls, `$base..HEAD` range operator, `TestResponse::assertSee` second-argument selector.
- **Updated Files:**
  - `app/Controllers/Inbox.php`, `tests/session/InboxHandoffTest.php`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
    `app/Views/inbox/index.php` — all committed across the 9 commits above.
  - `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md` — this checkpoint appended (append-only).
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Executed strictly to the plan/spec contracts; no redesign, no new task, no Phase-2 work before explicit approval.
  - Phase 1 stopped at the TASK-110 APPROVAL gate; Phase 2 only started after the user's explicit "saya setujui".
  - The normative gate order Q3 is preserved end-to-end: 404 → 409 `selesai` → 400 validation → 403 initiator → 403 target
    → fail-fast 409 → conditional-write transaction.
  - No new ADR (reversible hardening + adopted clarifications; Triple Gate fails).
- **Next Action / Pending:**
  - **NEW session:** `/sdlc-define-specs` to finalise `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md`
    (Q2 narrowing restatement, P-01..P-06, 4096 = characters, shared 409 shape with nullable `current_owner_id`,
    Q3 gate order, CR-04=A1 + CR-03=A semantics, three 403 branches). Documentation-only; no source code.
  - Then the usual downstream path: `/sdlc-clarify-reqs` → `/sdlc-plan-tasks` → `/sdlc-generate-docs`.
  - This session's write-code scope is CLOSED at HEAD `51fb1fc`.

<!-- checkpoint-tail: M3 Fase 2a WRITE-CODE is DONE for BOTH phases in one session — Phase 1 (TASK-101..TASK-110) and, after explicit user approval, Phase 2 (TASK-201 fail-fast 409 before transBegin reusing balas409KepemilikanBasi, TASK-202 narrowed belum_diambil gate + three-branch 403 + UI mirror; TASK-203 VOID), 9 small commits ending at HEAD 51fb1fc with the full suite green at 298 tests / 948 assertions (from 283/867), all 7 protected methods untouched and zero diff on ConversationModel/InboxSlaService/InboxGatewayApi; the only remaining step is a NEW /sdlc-define-specs session to finalise the stale Fase 2a Spec. -->

## 📝 Session Checkpoint: 2026-09-23 (M3 Fase 2a Spec Finalisation)

- **Active Memory Path:** `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md`
- **Current SDLC Phase:** Specification (`/sdlc-define-specs`) — **completed** for the physical finalisation of
  `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` (v1.0 → **v1.1**). Documentation-only session:
  **no source code, test, migration, schema, or Gateway call** was touched; only that one spec file was modified
  (plus this checkpoint). Architect boundary honoured strictly.
- **Active Artifacts:**
  - `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` — ✅ **v1.1, no longer stale** (392 lines,
    +72 / reworked in place). Readiness **95/100** (Completeness 38, Clarity 28, Alignment 29, no Critical Flaw Veto).
  - `plan/plan-feature-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-v1.0.md` — ✅ unchanged (normative; wins on conflict, RISK-01/CON-003).
  - `docs/audit/clarification-report-m3-fase2a-refactor-plan-2026-09-23.md` — ✅ unchanged (source of CR-03=A / CR-04=A1).
- **Achieved Milestones:**
  - **Six deliverables landed as surgical edits** (no full rewrite, per Surgical Edit Mandate):
    1. **Q2 narrowing (LOCKED)** — new Decision-Log row `Q2 (ditolak)` + a `> [!IMPORTANT]` block: an **admin
       non-assignee stays 403** on `belum_diambil`; the Plan wins over Q2 (RISK-01/CON-003) as a deliberate narrowing
       (product reason: closes the forbidden admin forced-handoff path; an admin can still claim first via
       `ambilPercakapan()`). Zero code/test/UI change.
    2. **P-01..P-06 explicit** — new **§1.2.2 "Patch Normatif"** table mapping each patch → binding contract → affected
       sections; `P-01..P-06` also appended to the Decision Log §1.2.1.
    3. **4096 = CHARACTERS** — §4.1 switched `summary`/`next_action` to `VARCHAR(4096)` (+ `note` = `TEXT` with a
       4096-controller cap) and added a CR-05 note (`mb_strlen` matches `VARCHAR(4096)`/`maxlength`). §4.4 now defines
       **two 409 families** (state `selesai` + ownership) with **one shared body** that includes **`current_owner_id`
       (nullable)** — this closes CR-06.
    4. **Q3 gate order** — §4.3 flow listed as 8 numbered steps and repeated as a compact block:
       **404 → 409 selesai → 400 → 403 initiator → 403 target → fail-fast 409 → conditional-write transaction**.
    5. **Latest semantics** — **CR-04 = A1** (fail-fast 409 before `transBegin()`, after both 403 gates, body
       byte-identical to the loser 409) at §4.3 step 6 + AC-H09; **CR-03 = A** (unowned exception only for
       `queue_status === 'belum_diambil'`) at §4.3 step 4 + the **three 403 message branches (i)/(ii)/(iii)** note in §4.4.
    6. **Open assumptions flagged** — `ASSUMPTION-002` (LOCKED by P-01), `ASSUMPTION-003` (SUPERSEDED by P-03), and new
       `ASSUMPTION-008..011` (Belum-Diambil ≠ tanpa-pemilik; residual window between fail-fast and conditional write;
       409 two-family body; H/C/G/E/F test-id mapping).
  - **Alignment edits:** REQ-H01/H02/H03/H08, AC-H02 (now 409), new AC-H08/AC-H09, §12 edge cases (initiator-not-owner
    now 403; `selesai` now 409), §15 traceability rows, and §4.3b (new GET endpoint, P-04). Introduction carries a
    v1.1 banner (Plan wins on conflict; docs-only).
  - **Verification:** targeted search confirms **no stale contract text remains** (every `500`/`selesai`=403/admin-boleh
    hit is now an explicit "was X, corrected by P-0N" reference); manual structural check via PowerShell → single H1,
    zero trailing whitespace, zero tabs, 392 lines.
- **Dead-Ends (Do NOT Repeat):**
  - **Attempted:** capturing the spec's lint via the repo-cached markdownlint CLI
    (`cmd /c "npx --no-install markdownlint-cli <file> > build\md-spec-fase2a.txt 2>&1"`).
    **Reason:** on this machine npx refused — `npm error npx canceled due to missing packages and no YES option:
    ["markdownlint-cli@0.48.0"]` (this **supersedes** the earlier "repo-cached CLI IS available" note for this run);
    the follow-up `find /c "MD"` returned `0`, which is exactly the DE-34 trap (empty redirect ≠ clean lint).
    **Note:** validate specs with the manual PowerShell rule script
    (`[System.IO.File]::ReadAllLines($p,[Text.Encoding]::UTF8)` + shape/max-length/trailing-ws checks), never read
    "0 bytes / 0 matches" as "clean".
  - **Attempted (twice):** emitting a `replace_in_file` call whose opening `<parameter name="diff">` tag was malformed.
    **Reason:** the tool received an EMPTY `diff` parameter → "The 'diff' parameter was empty" (no file change).
    **Note:** keep the call format exactly `<parameter name="diff">…</parameter>`; syntax slips silently void the edit.
  - Repo-wide dead-ends unchanged, referenced by label only: git index lock on parallel git calls, PowerShell
    `$base..HEAD` range operator, `TestResponse::assertSee` second-argument selector, phpunit piped through PowerShell,
    `php -r` inner-quote stripping in PS 5.1.
- **Updated Files:**
  - `spec/spec-design-m3-operational-inbox-fase2a-handoff-collision.md` — v1.0 → v1.1 (the six deliverables + alignment).
  - `.claude/instructions/memory.instructions.md` — this checkpoint appended (append-only).
  - No `app/`, `tests/`, `plan/`, `docs/`, `CONTEXT.md`, PRD or config file was touched.
- **Decisions Made:**
  - Spec finalisation stayed **documentation-only**; the Architect never wrote code and did not re-interrogate locked
    items (Q1, Q3, Q5..Q9, K-01..K-09, P-01..P-06, CR-01/02/05..09) — only restated the new CR-03/CR-04 locks and Q2.
  - No new ADR (Triple Gate fails: reversible text clarifications, unsurprising given Q2/REQ-H01, no new trade-off).
  - Header language of the §4.1 schema table kept as v1.0 (English) while new surrounding notes are bilingual —
    reported as a cosmetic deduction, not fixed silently.
  - Spec authoring language = Indonesian, matching the v1.0 file and its `spec/` sibling (the project's Specs are
    Indonesian, unlike the English `/plan/` docs) — an observed convention, not a new policy.
- **Next Action / Pending:**
  - **Spec is READY (95/100).** User Decision Prompt issued: **PROCEED** (recommended) or **REFINE**.
  - **NEW session (one persona per session):** `/sdlc-clarify-reqs` on the v1.1 Spec (target ASSUMPTION-008..011), then
    `/sdlc-plan-tasks` if the clarification asks for plan changes, then `/sdlc-generate-docs` (Diátaxis).
  - **Nothing pushed yet:** HEAD remains `51fb1fc`; the spec edit and this checkpoint are uncommitted (working tree
    dirty) — commit when the user asks (chain git with `;` in one command per DE-01).
  - This memory file **still has no Knowledge Base zone** (now overdue across seven checkpoints) — a Compaction Mode
    run should finally create it and promote the accumulated dead-end list.
