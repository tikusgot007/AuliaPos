# Bug Remediation Plan: [Issue Name / Symptom]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **FIRST PRINCIPLES BUG FIXING DIRECTIVE:**  
> Cease blind patching. Do not apply speculative workarounds. Follow the Prove-It Pattern: write a failing reproduction test first, verify the failure, then implement the minimal root-cause remediation.

## 1. Problem Classification: Problems to Prove

- **Observed Symptom:** [Exact error message, stack trace, or anomalous behavior]
- **The Hypothesis:** [Root cause explanation derived from First Principles]
- **Contradiction / Minimal Counterexample:** [The exact input, state, or concurrency race that produces the failure]

---

## 2. Tracing the Broken Seam

*Data flow traversal across Clean Architecture layers from trigger to failure point:*

```text
1. Trigger: [User Action / Webhook / Event]
   └── Payload: [Input parameters]
2. Interface Adapter (Controller / Gateway):
   └── Expected: [Valid data mapping]
   └── Actual: [Divergence point / unhandled null / state loss] ❌ BROKEN SEAM
3. Use Case Interactor:
   └── Cascading failure: [Unhandled rejection / state corruption]
4. Domain Entity / Persistence:
   └── Result: [Corrupted state / crash]
```

- **Exact Broken Seam Location:** `[file_path:line_number]`
- **Root Cause Category:** [Data Race / Unbounded Condition / State Desynchronization / Type Boundary Leak]
- **Bisection Search Protocol (Pólya, p. 206–209):** [Explain how the search space was halved via binary bisection (e.g., git bisect, call stack bisection, middleware payload logging) to eliminate blind trial-and-error]

## 3. Implementation Steps (The Prove-It Pattern)

### Phase 1: Test Writing (Isolate & Prove the Failure)
*Goal: Formulate a targeted reproduction test that fails for the exact root cause.*

| Task ID  | Description                                               | Files Impacted | Completed |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :-------: |
| TASK-101 | Write targeted reproduction unit/integration test         | `tests/...`    |    [ ]    |
| TASK-10X | **VERIFY:** Run test. Test MUST FAIL with expected error. | `tests/...`    |    [ ]    |
| TASK-10Y | **APPROVAL:** 🛑 Stop and confirm reproduction with user   | Gate           |    [ ]    |

### Phase 2: Surgical Root Cause Remediation
*Goal: Apply the minimal fix that restores system invariants without cascading changes.*

| Task ID  | Description                                                        | Files Impacted | Completed |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :-------: |
| TASK-201 | Apply minimal root-cause fix at the broken seam                    | `src/...`      |    [ ]    |
| TASK-202 | Clean up adjacent code per Boy Scout Rule (no new abstractions)    | `src/...`      |    [ ]    |
| TASK-20X | **VERIFY:** Run Phase 1 test (MUST PASS) and run entire test suite | `tests/...`    |    [ ]    |
| TASK-20Y | **APPROVAL:** 🛑 Stop and request user review of fix                | Gate           |    [ ]    |

## 4. Invariant Protection & Regression Defense

- **Restored Invariant:** [What core system rule is now permanently guaranteed?]
- **Negative Testing (*Reductio ad Absurdum*):** [Targeted test proving the invalid state cannot re-occur]

---

## 5. Circuit-Breaker & Incubation Contingency (Anti-Looping)

- **Retry Budget:** Maximum 2–3 failed reproduction or fix attempts before triggering hard-stop.
- **Circuit-Breaker Trigger Criteria:** If test reproduction fails to isolate the broken seam, or a patch introduces cascading failures across $\ge 2$ adjacent modules.
- **Contradiction / Dilemma Log (Populate only if Circuit-Breaker triggers):**
  - *Flawed Assumption:* [What underlying hypothesis proved false at runtime?]
  - *Observed Invariant Violation:* [What is the exact divergence between theoretical expectation and runtime data?]
  - *Decompose & Recombine Escalation:* [Step back to Phase 1 (Understanding the Problem), formulate 2-3 alternate hypotheses, or request missing telemetry from user]

## 6. Rollback Strategy

1. Revert fix commits: `git revert HEAD`
2. Restore previous database state if migrations were applied.
