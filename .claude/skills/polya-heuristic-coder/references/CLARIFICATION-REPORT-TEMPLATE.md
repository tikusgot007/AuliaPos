## 📊 Score Breakdown (Quality Gate Rubric)

- **Completeness (40%):** `{Score}` / 40  
  *Rationale:* {Are Unknown, Data, Condition, and all Clean Architecture seams explicitly documented?}

  *Rationale:* {Is fuzzy language eliminated? Are contracts strictly typed with no ambiguous terms?}
- **Alignment (30%):** `{Score}` / 30  
  *Rationale:* {Does vocabulary strictly match `CONTEXT.md`? Are architectural decisions compliant with `docs/adr/`?}
- **Critical Flaw Veto:** `{Triggered / None}`  
  *(Note: If triggered, maximum allowable score is capped at 79 regardless of weighted points).*
